# Audit - Intro

You just joined the project and, eager to get up to speed, you ask the tech lead where the documentation is. He looks up from his screen, a knowing smile playing at the corners of his lips, and replies, "Well, that's an interesting story...

![Documentation](images/image.jpeg)

After further discussion, he gives you the openAPI file 'petstoreMinimal.json' that hasn't been updated in a while. Anyway this is a good basis for starting to work with the Audit. To your great surprise, it doesn't meet the company's minimum criteria and you take the initiative to solve the problems.
Upon a brief examination, it becomes evident that there are authorization issues and missing constraints related to the Petstore object.

# How to run the Audit

There are two ways to run the Audit:

- Using the 42Crunch UI Platform
    - Go to the https://platform.42crunch.com/ page and login
    - Create a collection in the API Collection page
    - Import an API inside the collection
    - Read the Audit report in the 'Security Audit Report' tab
    - Update the specification and re-run the audit in the 'Security editor tag'
    - More documentation : https://42crunch.com/tutorial-api-security-audit/
- Using the 42Crunch IDE Extension
    - Open your IDE VSCode/IntelliJ
    - Install the 42Crunch extension
        - VSCode (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi)
        - IntelliJ (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14837-openapi-swagger-editor)
    - Create an IDE token in the page https://platform.42crunch.com/
    - Setup the extension in the IDE
        - VSCode : Ctrl + Shift + P : Update platform credentials
    - Open an OpenAPI Specification file and click on the top right 42Crunch logo

# Improvements

All right, after a short interview with the tech lead guy, you can gather the following information regarding the specification :

Server : 

- For this demo, you can put https in the schema because the API will be executed in production.

```
"servers": [
    {
        "url": "https://localhost:4010"
    }
],
```

FindPetstores: 

- Does not require any authentication

```
 "/petstores": {
    "get": {
        "operationId": "FindPetstores",
        "x-42c-no-authentication": true
        ....
    }
 }
```

CreatePetstore: 

- Requires 'ApiKeyAdmin' or 'CookieAdmin'

```
"/petstores": {
    "post": {
        "operationId": "CreatePetstore",
        "security": [
            {
                "ApiKeyAdmin":[]
            },
            {
                "CookieAdmin":[]
            }
        ],
    }
}
```

Regarding schema objects:

Petstore: 

- Replace minLength/maxLength by minItems/maxItems

```
 "Petstores": {
    "type": "object",
    "required": [
        "items"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "items": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Petstore"
            },
            "minItems": 0,
            "maxItems": 100
        }
    }
},
```

Petname: 

- Add constraint in the json schema:

```
{
    "type": "string",
    "pattern": "^[a-zA-Z]{5,10}$",
    "minLength": 5,
    "maxLength": 10,
    "example": "Petstore"
}

```

Id:

- Add constraint in the json schema:

```
{
    "type": "string",
    "format": "string",
    "pattern": "[a-fA-F0-9]{8}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{12}",
    "maxLength": 36,
    "minLength": 36,
    "example": "7fd1b0b3-d0fc-4986-abe8-e92742d42644"
}
                
```

After all theses changes you should see the following score :
